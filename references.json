Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., ‘drug treats disease’, ‘gene interacts with gene’). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.</jats:p>",

Here we present the Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG), an open-source platform currently comprising close to 20 million nodes and 220 million relationships that represent relevant experimental data, public databases and literature. The graph structure provides a flexible data model that is easily extendable to new nodes and relationships as new databases become available. The CKG incorporates statistical and machine learning algorithms that accelerate the analysis and interpretation of typical proteomics workflows. Using a set of proof-of-concept biomarker studies, we show how the CKG might augment and enrich proteomics data and help inform clinical decision-making.</jats:p>",

The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene–disease prioritization. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, while relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data are required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorized according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and an evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, while also highlighting key future research directions. We hope this review will motivate KGs use in solving key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.</jats:p>",

However, different layers of the available data are produced using different technologies and scattered across individual computational resources without any explicit connections to each other, which hinders extensive and integrative multi-omics-based analysis. We aimed to address this issue by developing a new data integration/representation methodology and its application by constructing a biological data resource. CROssBAR is a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biological/biomedical data from various resources and stores them in a NoSQL database. CROssBAR is enriched with the deep-learning-based prediction of relationships between numerous data entries, which is followed by the rigorous analysis of the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules. These complex sets of entities and relationships are displayed to users via easy-to-interpret, interactive knowledge graphs within an open-access service. CROssBAR knowledge graphs incorporate relevant genes-proteins, molecular interactions, pathways, phenotypes, diseases, as well as known/predicted drugs and bioactive compounds, and they are constructed on-the-fly based on simple non-programmatic user queries. These intensely processed heterogeneous networks are expected to aid systems-level research, especially to infer biological mechanisms in relation to genes, proteins, their ligands, and diseases.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Large transformer-based language models have achieved incredible success at various tasks which require narrative comprehension, including story completion, answering questions about stories, and generating stories ex nihilo. However, due to the limitations of finite context windows, these language models struggle to produce or understand stories longer than several thousand tokens. In order to mitigate the document length limitations that come with finite context windows, we introduce a novel architecture that augments story processing with an external dynamic knowledge graph. In contrast to static commonsense knowledge graphs which hold information about the real world, these dynamic knowledge graphs reflect facts extracted from the story being processed. Our architecture uses these knowledge graphs to create information-rich prompts which better facilitate story comprehension than prompts composed only of story text. We apply our architecture to the tasks of question answering and story completion. To complement this line of research, we introduce two long-form question answering tasks, LF-SQuAD and LF-QUOREF, in which the document length exceeds the size of the language model's context window, and introduce a story completion evaluation method that bypasses the stochastic nature of language model generation. We demonstrate broad improvement over typical prompt formulation methods for both question answering and story completion using GPT-2, GPT-3 and XLNet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The wealth of knowledge we have amassed in the context of biomedical science has grown exponentially in the last decades. Consequently, understanding and contextualising scientific results has become increasingly difficult for any single individual. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) can remember an enormous amount of information, but have notable shortcomings, such as a lack of generalised awareness, logical deficits, and a propensity to hallucinate. To improve biomedical analyses, we propose to combine human ingenuity and machine memory by means of an open and modular conversational platform, biochatter (https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter), exemplified in the web application ChatGSE (https://chat.biocypher.org). We safeguard against common LLM shortcomings using general and biomedicine-specific measures and allow automated integration of popular bioinformatics methods. Ultimately, we aim to improve the AI-readiness of biomedicine and make LLMs more useful and trustworthy in research applications.",
