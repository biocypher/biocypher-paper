The ~1.93 million curated interactions in BioGRID can be used to build complex networks to facilitate biomedical discoveries, particularly as related to human health and disease. All BioGRID content is curated from primary experimental evidence in the biomedical literature, and includes both focused low‐throughput studies and large high‐throughput datasets. BioGRID also captures protein post‐translational modifications and protein or gene interactions with bioactive small molecules including many known drugs. A built‐in network visualization tool combines all annotations and allows users to generate network graphs of protein, genetic and chemical interactions. In addition to general curation across species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in specific aspects of cellular regulation, for example the ubiquitin‐proteasome system, as well as specific disease areas, such as for the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus that causes COVID‐19 severe acute respiratory syndrome. A recent extension of BioGRID, named the Open Repository of CRISPR Screens (ORCS, <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://orcs.thebiogrid.org\">orcs.thebiogrid.org</jats:ext-link>), captures single mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions from published high throughput genome‐wide CRISPR/Cas9‐based genetic screens. BioGRID‐ORCS contains datasets for over 1,042 CRISPR screens carried out to date in human, mouse and fly cell lines. The biomedical research community can freely access all BioGRID data through the web interface, standardized file downloads, or via model organism databases and partner meta‐databases.</jats:p>",

Integrating the datasets resulting from these studies is necessary to adequately represent the heterogeneity of human cancers and to assemble a comprehensive map of cancer genetic vulnerabilities. Here, we integrated the two largest public independent CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed to date (at the Broad and Sanger institutes) by assessing, comparing, and selecting methods for correcting biases due to heterogeneous single-guide RNA efficiency, gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9 targeting originated from copy number alterations, and experimental batch effects. Our integrated datasets recapitulate findings from the individual datasets, provide greater statistical power to cancer- and subtype-specific analyses, unveil additional biomarkers of gene dependency, and improve the detection of common essential genes. We provide the largest integrated resources of CRISPR-Cas9 screens to date and the basis for harmonizing existing and future functional genetics datasets.</jats:p>",

The increasing scale and complexity of molecular data generated from comprehensive sequencing of cancer samples requires advanced interpretative platforms as precision oncology expands beyond individual patients to entire populations. To address this unmet need, we introduce a Platform for Oncogenomic Reporting and Interpretation (PORI), comprising an analytic framework that facilitates the interpretation and reporting of somatic variants in cancer. PORI integrates reporting and graph knowledge base tools combined with support for manual curation at the reporting stage. PORI represents an open-source platform alternative to commercial reporting solutions suitable for comprehensive genomic data sets in precision oncology. We demonstrate the utility of PORI by matching 9,961 pan-cancer genome atlas tumours to the graph knowledge base, calculating therapeutically informative alterations, and making available reports describing select individual samples.</jats:p>",

Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods’ predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide LIANA, a LIgand-receptor ANalysis frAmework as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods.</jats:p>",

Here we develop NeuronChat, a method and package for the inference, visualization and analysis of neural-specific communication networks among pre-defined cell groups using single-cell expression data. We incorporate a manually curated molecular interaction database of neural signaling for both human and mouse, and benchmark NeuronChat on several published datasets to validate its ability in predicting neural connectivity. Then, we apply NeuronChat to three different neural tissue datasets to illustrate its functionalities in identifying interneural communication networks, revealing conserved or context-specific interactions across different biological contexts, and predicting communication pattern changes in diseased brains with autism spectrum disorder. Finally, we demonstrate NeuronChat can utilize spatial transcriptomics data to infer and visualize neural-specific cell-cell communication.</jats:p>",

Historically, limited tissue accessibility, a lack of reliable in vitro models and critical differences between humans and mice have hampered our knowledge of human gonadogenesis, despite its importance in gonadal conditions and infertility. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of first- and second-trimester human gonads using a combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility assays and fluorescent microscopy. We extracted human-specific regulatory programmes that control the development of germline and somatic cell lineages by profiling equivalent developmental stages in mice. In both species, we define the somatic cell states present at the time of sex specification, including the bipotent early supporting population that, in males, upregulates the testis-determining factor <jats:italic>SRY</jats:italic> and sPAX8s, a gonadal lineage located at the gonadal–mesonephric interface. In females, we resolve the cellular and molecular events that give rise to the first and second waves of granulosa cells that compartmentalize the developing ovary to modulate germ cell differentiation. In males, we identify human <jats:italic>SIGLEC15</jats:italic><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and <jats:italic>TREM2</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>+</jats:italic></jats:sup> fetal testicular macrophages, which signal to somatic cells outside and inside the developing testis cords, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of human and mouse gonadal differentiation, which can guide in vitro gonadogenesis.</jats:p>",

Here we present the Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG), an open-source platform currently comprising close to 20 million nodes and 220 million relationships that represent relevant experimental data, public databases and literature. The graph structure provides a flexible data model that is easily extendable to new nodes and relationships as new databases become available. The CKG incorporates statistical and machine learning algorithms that accelerate the analysis and interpretation of typical proteomics workflows. Using a set of proof-of-concept biomarker studies, we show how the CKG might augment and enrich proteomics data and help inform clinical decision-making.</jats:p>",

Several registries have been developed to catalog resources maintaining identifiers for biomedical entities such as small molecules, proteins, cell lines, and clinical trials. However, existing registries have struggled to provide sufficient coverage and metadata standards that meet the evolving needs of modern life sciences researchers. Here, we introduce the Bioregistry, an integrative, open, community-driven metaregistry that synthesizes and substantially expands upon 23 existing registries. The Bioregistry addresses the need for a sustainable registry by leveraging public infrastructure and automation, and employing a progressive governance model centered around open code and open data to foster community contribution. The Bioregistry can be used to support the standardized annotation of data, models, ontologies, and scientific literature, thereby promoting their interoperability and reuse. The Bioregistry can be accessed through <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://bioregistry.io\">https://bioregistry.io</jats:ext-link> and its source code and data are available under the MIT and CC0 Licenses at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry\">https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>",

The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.</jats:p>",

Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene–disease prioritization. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, while relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data are required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorized according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and an evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, while also highlighting key future research directions. We hope this review will motivate KGs use in solving key and emerging questions in the drug discovery domain.</jats:p>",

This vast amount of information has led to numerous machine learning-based biological applications using either text through natural language processing (NLP) or structured data through knowledge graph embedding models. However, representations based on a single modality are inherently limited.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To generate better representations of biological knowledge, we propose STonKGs, a Sophisticated Transformer trained on biomedical text and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This multimodal Transformer uses combined input sequences of structured information from KGs and unstructured text data from biomedical literature to learn joint representations in a shared embedding space. First, we pre-trained STonKGs on a knowledge base assembled by the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler consisting of millions of text-triple pairs extracted from biomedical literature by multiple NLP systems. Then, we benchmarked STonKGs against three baseline models trained on either one of the modalities (i.e. text or KG) across eight different classification tasks, each corresponding to a different biological application. Our results demonstrate that STonKGs outperforms both baselines, especially on the more challenging tasks with respect to the number of classes, improving upon the F1-score of the best baseline by up to 0.084 (i.e. from 0.881 to 0.965). Finally, our pre-trained model as well as the model architecture can be adapted to various other transfer learning applications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We make the source code and the Python package of STonKGs available at GitHub (https://github.com/stonkgs/stonkgs) and PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/stonkgs/).

The evaluation shows that the main structure of the formats is similar. However, SBML is tuned towards simulation models of molecular pathways while PSI MI is more suitable for representing details about particular interactions and experiments. BioPAX is the most general and expressive of the formats. These differences are apparent in allowed information and the structure for representation of interactions. We discuss the impact of these differences both with respect to information content in existing databases and computational properties for import and analysis of data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact:  lestr@ida.liu.se</jats:p>",

KGs are typically stored in a graph-database format, and graph-database queries can be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by users such as biomedical researchers. For simple queries, the inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more challenging with each increase in complexity of the query. For instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with hundreds of thousands of query results. Thus, the ability to efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research and other domains. We present Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways as an abstraction layer and user interface to more easily query KGs and store, rank and explore query results.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>An instance of the ROBOKOP UI for exploration of the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph can be found at http://robokop.renci.org.

Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

We describe expansion in content over nine database releases made during the last two years, which has focussed on three main areas of infection. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact on health worldwide. GtoPdb has sought to support the wider research community to understand the pharmacology of emerging drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential targets in the host to block viral entry and reduce the adverse effects of infection in patients with COVID-19. We describe how the database rapidly evolved to include a new family of Coronavirus proteins. Malaria remains a global threat to half the population of the world. Our database content continues to be enhanced through our collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) on the IUPHAR/MMV Guide to MALARIA PHARMACOLOGY (www.guidetomalariapharmacology.org). Antibiotic resistance is also a growing threat to global health. In response, we have extended our coverage of antibacterials in partnership with AntibioticDB.</jats:p>",

These include improved reaction coverage in Rhea, the adoption of Rhea as the reference vocabulary for enzyme annotation in the UniProt knowledgebase UniProtKB (https://www.uniprot.org), the development of a new Rhea website, and the designation of Rhea as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource.

The processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied (‘dark’) proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome’s manually curated pathways.</jats:p>",

Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB’s ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.</jats:p>",

However, different layers of the available data are produced using different technologies and scattered across individual computational resources without any explicit connections to each other, which hinders extensive and integrative multi-omics-based analysis. We aimed to address this issue by developing a new data integration/representation methodology and its application by constructing a biological data resource. CROssBAR is a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biological/biomedical data from various resources and stores them in a NoSQL database. CROssBAR is enriched with the deep-learning-based prediction of relationships between numerous data entries, which is followed by the rigorous analysis of the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules. These complex sets of entities and relationships are displayed to users via easy-to-interpret, interactive knowledge graphs within an open-access service. CROssBAR knowledge graphs incorporate relevant genes-proteins, molecular interactions, pathways, phenotypes, diseases, as well as known/predicted drugs and bioactive compounds, and they are constructed on-the-fly based on simple non-programmatic user queries. These intensely processed heterogeneous networks are expected to aid systems-level research, especially to infer biological mechanisms in relation to genes, proteins, their ligands, and diseases.</jats:p>",

The database uses a knowledge graph to consolidate genomic datasets and annotations from over 30 consortia and portals, including 347 million genomic entities, 1.36 billion relations, and 3.9 billion entity and relation properties. GenomicKB is equipped with a web-based query system (https://gkb.dcmb.med.umich.edu/) which allows users to query the knowledge graph with customized graph patterns and specific constraints on entities and relations. Compared with traditional tabular-structured data stored in separate data portals, GenomicKB emphasizes the relations among genomic entities, intuitively connects isolated data matrices, and supports efficient queries for scientific discoveries. GenomicKB transforms complicated analysis among multiple genomic entities and relations into coding-free queries, and facilitates data-driven genomic discoveries in the future.</jats:p>",

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>BIGGER PICTURE</jats:title><jats:p>An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

Interaction networks can be used to expand the list of likely trait associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we used improvements in SNP-to-gene mapping to perform network based expansion of trait associated genes for 1,002 human traits showing that this recovers known disease genes or drug targets. The similarity of network expansion scores identifies groups of traits likely to share a common genetic basis as well as the biological processes underlying this. We identified 73 pleiotropic gene modules linked to multiple traits that are enriched in genes involved in processes such as protein ubiquitination and RNA processing. We show examples of modules linked to human diseases enriched in genes with pathogenic variants found in patients or relevant mouse knock-out phenotypes and can be used to map targets of approved drugs for repurposing opportunities. Finally, we illustrate the use of the network expansion scores to study genes at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS loci, and implicate IBD-relevant genes with strong functional and genetic support.</jats:p>",

Besides the common requirements to organisational knowledge graphs such as being able to capture the domain precisely and give the users the ability to search and query the data, the focus on handling multiple use cases and supporting use case-specific machine learning models presents additional challenges: the data models must also be streamlined for the performance of downstream tasks; graph content must be easily customisable for different use cases; different projections of the graph content are required to support a wider range of different consumption modes.

However, such knowledge is fragmented across publications, non-standardized research repositories, and evolving ontologies describing various scales of biological organization between genotypes and clinical phenotypes. Here, we present PrimeKG, a precision medicine-oriented knowledge graph that provides a holistic view of diseases. PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scale, and the entire range of approved and experimental drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG supports drug-disease prediction by including an abundance of ‘indications’, ‘contradictions’ and ‘off-label use’ edges, which are usually missing in other knowledge graphs. We accompany PrimeKG’s graph structure with text descriptions of clinical guidelines for drugs and diseases to enable multimodal analyses.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We developed MEBOCOST, a computational algorithm for quantitatively inferring metabolite-mediated intercellular communications using single cell RNA-seq data. The algorithm identifies cell-cell communications in which metabolites, such as lipids, are secreted by sender cells and traveled to interact with sensor proteins of receiver cells. The sensor proteins on receiver cell might be cell surface receptors, transporters across the cell membrane, or nuclear receptors. MEBOCOST relies on a comprehensive database of metabolite-sensor partners, which we manually curated from the literatures and other public sources. MEBOCOST defines sender and receiver cells for an extracellular metabolite based on the expression levels of the enzymes and sensors, respectively, thus identifies metabolite-sensor communications between the cells. Applying MEBOCOST to mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT) successfully recaptured known metabolite-mediated cell communications and further identified new communications.

However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multi-gene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present GEARS, a method that can predict transcriptional response to both single and multi-gene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is uniquely able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of novel genes that were never experimentally perturbed by leveraging geometric deep learning and a knowledge graph of gene-gene relationships. GEARS has higher precision than existing approaches in predicting five distinct genetic interaction subtypes and can identify the strongest interactions more than twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can discover novel phenotypic outcomes to multi-gene perturbations and can thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.</jats:p>",

Graph‐based data models elucidate the interconnectedness among core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these “knowledge graphs” (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally accepted, open‐access model for standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream consumers. Biolink Model is an open‐source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object‐oriented classification and graph‐oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates) representing biomedical entities such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomic structure, and phenotype. The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here, we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Metabolic networks are interconnected and influence diverse cellular processes. The protein-metabolite interactions that mediate these networks are frequently low affinity and challenging to systematically discover. We developed mass spectrometry integrated with equilibrium dialysis for the discovery of allostery systematically (MIDAS) to identify such interactions. Analysis of 33 enzymes from human carbohydrate metabolism identified 830 protein-metabolite interactions, including known regulators, substrates, and products as well as previously unreported interactions. We functionally validated a subset of interactions, including the isoform-specific inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by long-chain acyl–coenzyme A. Cell treatment with fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate-lactate interconversion dependent on lactate dehydrogenase isoform expression. These protein-metabolite interactions may contribute to the dynamic, tissue-specific metabolic flexibility that enables growth and survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment.</jats:p>",

Such systems depend on formally represented knowledge in computer systems, often in the form of knowledge graphs. Here we survey recent progress in systems that use formally represented knowledge to address data science problems in both clinical and biological domains, as well as progress on approaches for creating knowledge graphs. Major themes include the relationships between knowledge graphs and machine learning, the use of natural language processing to construct knowledge graphs, and the expansion of novel knowledge-based approaches to clinical and biological domains. </jats:p>",

To address these challenges, there is an urgent need to inspire and encourage scientists to propose and pursue innovative research studies that aim to uncover the genetic and molecular causes of more rare diseases and ultimately to identify effective therapeutic solutions. A clear understanding of current research efforts, knowledge/research gaps, and funding patterns as scientific evidence is crucial to systematically accelerate the pace of research discovery in rare diseases, which is an overarching goal of this study.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>To semantically represent NIH funding data for rare diseases and advance its use of effectively promoting rare disease research, we identified NIH funded projects for rare diseases by mapping GARD diseases to the project based on project titles; subsequently we presented and managed those identified projects in a knowledge graph using Neo4j software, hosted at NCATS, based on a pre-defined data model that captures semantics among the data.

Systems such as International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), and National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt) provide large sets of cancer classification terminologies but they lack a dynamic modernized cancer classification platform that addresses the fast-evolving needs in clinical reporting of genomic sequencing results and associated oncology research. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS</jats:title><jats:p> To meet these needs, we have developed OncoTree, an open-source cancer classification system.

    "abstract": "<ns4:p>In the era of Big Data, data collection underpins biological research more than ever before. In many cases, this can be as time-consuming as the analysis itself. It requires downloading multiple public databases with various data structures, and in general, spending days preparing the data before answering any biological questions. Here, we introduce Sherlock, an open-source, cloud-based big data platform (<ns4:ext-link xmlns:ns5=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns5:href=\"https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/\">https://earlham-sherlock.github.io/</ns4:ext-link>) to solve this problem. Sherlock provides a gap-filling way for computational biologists to store, convert, query, share and generate biology data while ultimately streamlining bioinformatics data management.<ns4:bold> </ns4:bold>The<ns4:bold> </ns4:bold>Sherlock platform offers a simple interface to leverage big data technologies, such as Docker and PrestoDB. Sherlock is designed to enable users to analyze, process, query and extract information from extremely complex and large data sets. Furthermore, Sherlock can handle different structured data (interaction, localization, or genomic sequence) from several sources and convert them to a common optimized storage format, for example, the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC). This format facilitates Sherlock’s ability to quickly and efficiently execute distributed analytical queries on extremely large data files and share datasets between teams.<ns4:bold> </ns4:bold>The Sherlock platform is freely available on GitHub, and contains specific loader scripts for structured data sources of genomics, interaction and expression databases. With these loader scripts, users can easily and quickly create and work with specific file formats, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or ORC. For computational biology and large-scale bioinformatics projects, Sherlock provides an open-source platform empowering data management, analytics, integration and collaboration through modern big data technologies.</ns4:p>",

At the cellular level we share biological mechanisms with species from which we diverged millions, even billions of years ago. We can exploit this common ancestry to learn about health and disease, by analyzing DNA and protein sequences, but also through the observable outcomes of genetic differences, i.e. phenotypes. To solve challenging disease problems we need to unify the heterogeneous data that relates genomics to disease traits. Without a big-picture view of phenotypic data, many questions in genetics are difficult or impossible to answer. The Monarch Initiative (https://monarchinitiative.org) provides tools for genotype-phenotype analysis, genomic diagnostics, and precision medicine across broad areas of disease.</jats:p>",

However, due to the limitations of finite context windows, these language models struggle to produce or understand stories longer than several thousand tokens. In order to mitigate the document length limitations that come with finite context windows, we introduce a novel architecture that augments story processing with an external dynamic knowledge graph. In contrast to static commonsense knowledge graphs which hold information about the real world, these dynamic knowledge graphs reflect facts extracted from the story being processed. Our architecture uses these knowledge graphs to create information-rich prompts which better facilitate story comprehension than prompts composed only of story text. We apply our architecture to the tasks of question answering and story completion. To complement this line of research, we introduce two long-form question answering tasks, LF-SQuAD and LF-QUOREF, in which the document length exceeds the size of the language model's context window, and introduce a story completion evaluation method that bypasses the stochastic nature of language model generation. We demonstrate broad improvement over typical prompt formulation methods for both question answering and story completion using GPT-2, GPT-3 and XLNet.</jats:p>",

GEMs have been successfully used in different research areas, ranging from systems medicine to biotechnology. However, the different naming conventions (namespaces) of databases used to build GEMs limit model reusability and prevent the integration of existing models. This problem is known in the GEM community, but its extent has not been analyzed in depth. In this study, we investigate the name ambiguity and the multiplicity of non-systematic identifiers and we highlight the (in)consistency in their use in 11 biochemical databases of biochemical reactions and the problems that arise when mapping between different namespaces and databases. We found that such inconsistencies can be as high as 83.1%, thus emphasizing the need for strategies to deal with these issues. Currently, manual verification of the mappings appears to be the only solution to remove inconsistencies when combining models. Finally, we discuss several possible approaches to facilitate (future) unambiguous mapping.</jats:p>",

Similar to other large international data sharing networks (e.g. OHDSI, PCORnet, eMerge, RD-Connect) MIRACUM is a consortium of academic and hospital partners as well as one industrial partner in eight German cities which have joined forces to create interoperable data integration centres (DIC) and make data within those DIC available for innovative new IT solutions in patient care and medical research.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Objectives: Sharing data shall be supported by common interoperable tools and services, in order to leverage the power of such data for biomedical discovery and moving towards a learning health system. This paper aims at illustrating the major building blocks and concepts which MIRACUM will apply to achieve this goal.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Governance and Policies: Besides establishing an efficient governance structure within the MIRACUM consortium (based on the steering board, a central administrative office, the general MIRACUM assembly, six working groups and the international scientific advisory board), defining DIC governance rules and data sharing policies, as well as establishing (at each MIRACUM DIC site, but also for MIRACUM in total) use and access committees are major building blocks for the success of such an endeavor.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Architectural Framework and Methodology:\nThe MIRACUM DIC architecture builds on a comprehensive ecosystem of reusable open source tools (MIRACOLIX), which are linkable and interoperable amongst each other, but also with the existing software environment of the MIRACUM hospitals. Efficient data protection measures, considering patient consent, data harmonization and a MIRACUM metadata repository as well as a common data model are major pillars of this framework. The methodological approach for shared data usage relies on a federated querying and analysis concept.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Use Cases: MIRACUM aims at proving the value of their DIC with three use cases: IT support for patient recruitment into clinical trials, the development and routine care implementation of a clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool, and molecular-guided therapy recommendations in molecular tumor boards.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Results: Based on the MIRACUM DIC release in the nine months conceptual phase first large scale analysis for stroke and colorectal cancer cohorts have been pursued.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          Discussion: Beyond all technological challenges successfully applying the MIRACUM tools for the enrichment of our knowledge about diagnostic and therapeutic concepts, thus supporting the concept of a Learning Health System will be crucial for the acceptance and sustainability in the medical community and the MIRACUM university hospitals.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown promising results in many areas and are driven by the increasing amount of available data. However, this data is often distributed across different institutions and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Privacy-preserving methods, such as Federated Learning (FL), allow for training ML models without sharing sensitive data, but their implementation is time-consuming and requires advanced programming skills. Here, we present the FeatureCloud AI Store for FL as an all-in-one platform for biomedical research and other applications. It removes large parts of this complexity for developers and end-users by providing an extensible AI Store with a collection of ready-to-use apps. We show that the federated apps produce similar results to centralized ML, scale well for a typical number of collaborators and can be combined with Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC), thereby making FL algorithms safely and easily applicable in biomedical and clinical environments.",

    "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) methods opened new avenues for addressing complex, real-world problems represented by graphs. However, many graphs used in these applications comprise millions of nodes and billions of edges and are beyond the capabilities of current methods and software implementations. We present GRAPE, a software resource for graph processing and embedding that can scale with big graphs by using specialized and smart data structures, algorithms, and a fast parallel implementation of random walk-based methods. Compared with state-of-the-art software resources, GRAPE shows an improvement of orders of magnitude in empirical space and time complexity, as well as a competitive edge and node label prediction performance. GRAPE comprises about 1.7 million well-documented lines of Python and Rust code and provides 69 node embedding methods, 25 inference models, a collection of efficient graph processing utilities and over 80,000 graphs from the literature and other sources. Standardized interfaces allow seamless integration of third-party libraries, while ready-to-use and modular pipelines permit an easy-to-use evaluation of GRL methods, therefore also positioning GRAPE as a software resource to perform a fair comparison between methods and libraries for graph processing and embedding.",

    "abstract": "In the commercial aviation domain, there are a large number of documents, like, accident reports (NTSB, ASRS) and regulatory directives (ADs). There is a need for a system to access these diverse repositories efficiently in order to service needs in the aviation industry, like maintenance, compliance, and safety. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) guided Deep Learning (DL) based Question Answering (QA) system for aviation safety. We construct a Knowledge Graph from Aircraft Accident reports and contribute this resource to the community of researchers. The efficacy of this resource is tested and proved by the aforesaid QA system. Natural Language Queries constructed from the documents mentioned above are converted into SPARQL (the interface language of the RDF graph database) queries and answered. On the DL side, we have two different QA models: (i) BERT QA which is a pipeline of Passage Retrieval (Sentence-BERT based) and Question Answering (BERT based), and (ii) the recently released GPT-3. We evaluate our system on a set of queries created from the accident reports. Our combined QA system achieves 9.3% increase in accuracy over GPT-3 and 40.3% increase over BERT QA. Thus, we infer that KG-DL performs better than either singly.",

    "abstract": "Pretraining a language model (LM) on text has been shown to help various downstream NLP tasks. Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction. DRAGON outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models on diverse downstream tasks including question answering across general and biomedical domains, with +5% absolute gain on average. In particular, DRAGON achieves notable performance on complex reasoning about language and knowledge (+10% on questions involving long contexts or multi-step reasoning) and low-resource QA (+8% on OBQA and RiddleSense), and new state-of-the-art results on various BioNLP tasks. Our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/michiyasunaga/dragon.",

    "abstract": "Despite the abundance of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR), its heterogeneity restricts the utilization of medical data in building predictive models. To address this challenge, we propose Universal Healthcare Predictive Framework (UniHPF), which requires no medical domain knowledge and minimal pre-processing for multiple prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that UniHPF is capable of building large-scale EHR models that can process any form of medical data from distinct EHR systems. We believe that our findings can provide helpful insights for further research on the multi-source learning of EHRs.",

    "abstract": "The wealth of knowledge we have amassed in the context of biomedical science has grown exponentially in the last decades. Consequently, understanding and contextualising scientific results has become increasingly difficult for any single individual. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) can remember an enormous amount of information, but have notable shortcomings, such as a lack of generalised awareness, logical deficits, and a propensity to hallucinate. To improve biomedical analyses, we propose to combine human ingenuity and machine memory by means of an open and modular conversational platform, biochatter (https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter), exemplified in the web application ChatGSE (https://chat.biocypher.org). We safeguard against common LLM shortcomings using general and biomedicine-specific measures and allow automated integration of popular bioinformatics methods. Ultimately, we aim to improve the AI-readiness of biomedicine and make LLMs more useful and trustworthy in research applications.",
